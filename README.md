Brave New Media AR Test by Baptiste Billard

// duration ----------------------------------

This test has been realised in more than 4 hours (mainly because of set-up and some device constraints).
However it probably took me around 3 or 4 hours of real programming / debugging.

To know the detail of my technical constraints and the issues I encountered, please read the post_mortem_eng.txt doc.

// how to get my work -----------------------

I worked on 1 unique project in which you will be able to run the 2 exercises, the 3rd one is readable in the doc named exercice3_fr.

• To get the Android project version, please checkout the commit called "Android Project Finished" (3rd commit from the end).
• To get the .apk I build, please checkout the commit called "Android .apk" (2nd commit from the end).
• To get the IOS project version, please checkout the commit called "IOS Project Finished" (3rd commit from the end).
