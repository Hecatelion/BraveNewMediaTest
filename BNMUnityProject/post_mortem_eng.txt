SET-UP / DEVICE ISSUES

- a lot of set up (updating Unity, installing AR packages, setting up properly the unity project)
- a lot of time lost because my phone was on Android 7.0, whereas Android 8.0 was needed, so I used a relative's phone on which I wasnt allowed to install Unity Remote and set the Developper Mode
- my last Android experience was on late 2018, so I had to remember phone UI properties
- never used AR, so I had to learn and try it before starting

PROG ISSUES MET 

- moving, rotating Tracked Prefab from its Reference Image
	-> solution : creating an empty parent prefab which became the Tracked Prefab and in which the Desk has been moved and rotated as I wished.

- Android UI bug found : UI not refreshing. It seems to be a knowned bug which appeared 1 or 2 years ago (so I didnt meet this bug on my last experiences)
	-> solution : work around using a coroutine which waits some milliseconds before initializing UI

- plane detection sometimes take pretty much time, especially on tiny areas
